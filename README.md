# esp32DigitalClock

This is just a course work for using ESP32.
## Instruction
Open the [new_clock_for_free_net.ino](https://github.com/yaalyy/esp32DigitalClock/blob/main/new_clock_for_free_net/new_clock_for_free_net.ino "new_clock_for_free_net.ino"), and modify the **WiFi SSID** and **Password**. Power up the ESP32, and a green message "Connection estabilished" will be displayed, once WiFi is successfully connected. After a few seconds, date and a clock will be displayed.
